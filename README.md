# Virtual Machine with LC-3 architecture
Rust implementation of a virtual machine that will simulate an LC-3 architecture

## VMs and LC-3
I believe that the author of the article from where this project gets its inspiration, explains in a really good and clear way both of these important points. Regarding Virtual Machines:

_"A VM is a program that acts like a computer. It simulates a CPU along with a few other hardware components, allowing it to perform arithmetic, read and write to memory, and interact with I/O devices, just like a physical computer. Most importantly, it can understand a machine language which you can use to program it."_

Regarding the LC-3 architecture:

_"Our VM will simulate the LC-3, an educational computer architecture commonly used to teach university students computer architecture and assembly. It has a simplified instruction set compared to x86, but demonstrates the main ideas used by modern CPUs."_

## Uses

Rust 1.85.0
